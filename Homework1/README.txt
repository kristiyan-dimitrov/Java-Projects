Hi Yintai,

This folder (Homework1) is basically the project folder from Eclipse IDE where I wrote my homework.

In Homework1 > src > problem1/2/3 you will find the .java files for each problem

In Homework1 > bin > problem1/2/3 you will find the compiled .class files for each problem

I believe you can import and run the project into Eclipse IDE by doing:

1) File > Import
2) Under "General" > Select "Existing Projects into Workspace"
3) Click Next
4) Next to "Select root directory:" hit Browse and open the unzipped Homework1 folder.

This  should load the project in your Eclipse IDE.
From there, you can run all the java files and see the appropriate outputs.

Hope this works, please let me know if it doesn't.

On my machine everything executes as intended.

Thanks,
Kristiyan
