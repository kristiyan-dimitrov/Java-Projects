In this project I implement:
1 superclass Appointment
3 subclasses extending that superclass: Onetime, Daily, Monthly
1 main class with menu where the user can:
 - create new appointments, 
 - check all appointments occurring on a specified date
 - save all created appointments to appointments.txt
 
Note that loading any existing appointments from appointments.txt happens automatically and is not a user option.

Note also that this entirel folder (Homework 2) is the Eclipse IDE project folder.
.java source files can be find in the src subfolder.
