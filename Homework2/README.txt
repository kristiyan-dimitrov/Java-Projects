Hi Yintai,

This is the project folder from Eclipse IDE, where I wrote my homework.

As instructed, there are 5 classes
- 1 for the superclass
- 3 for the subclasses
- 1 for testing all the functionalities

In the testing class, I display a menu which should allow you to play around with the functionalities I've build for creating appointments, saving to file, and checking all appointments that happen on a certain date.

Note that loading any existing appointments from appointments.txt happens automatically and is not a user option.

Let me know if you need any help running the code. At least on my side, everything appears to be running smoothly.

Thanks very much.

Kristiyan
